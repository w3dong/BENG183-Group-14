## 1. Introduction<a name="231"></a>
Have you wondered about how different kind of cells in our body are developed despite their similar DNA composition? Have you considered why some patients die from particular disease, while some do not? 
![Differential cell development](./assets/different-cell.png) ![different phenotype caused by differential expression](./assets/different-phenotype.png)

A foundamental concept underlying those phenomonon is the **Differential Expression of genes**. Genes are expressed differentially under different conditions to allow for different combinations of proteins and activation of certain biological pathway. Analyzing **differential expression of a set of genes** under different conditions can uncover mystery behind development of stem cells and cause of diseases [4]. 

Tools like **GSEA** can help us achieve this goal. However, before we dive deeper, let's start with some *basic concept review*. 

#### 1) Differential Expression and Differential Analysis of Genes<a name="2311"></a>

> **Differential Expression of genes** is *a evident change in read counts or expression level of genes under different conditions* [1]. 

Let's make a analogy here to help to understand this concept better. Let's consider different kinds of genes as different kinds of the lego building block.
![Lego blocks](./assets/lego-block.png) 
It's intuitive that you need many white lego blocks to build a cloud lego while some white lego blocks to build the black cat for its eyes. 
![Lego cloud](./assets/lego-cloud.png) ![Lego cat](./assets/lego-cat.png) 
In different biological conditions, same gene will be expressed in different amount based on needs. This phenomena is the differential expression of the gene. 

> **Differential analysis** is to *analyze significant change in gene expression level of **a gene** under different biological conditions*.
![Differential Analysis](./assets/DGE.png)[5] 

As its name, differential analysis is computational method used to detect **evident change of gene expression of *a gene* under different conditions**, **or between two phenotype**[2]. It will require inputs like raw counts of gene expression in different condition and conduct statistical analysis (like t-test) to check if difference is statistically significant. 
 
#### 2) Gene Set Enrichment Analysis<a name="2312"></a>

- **Gene Set Enrichment Analysis** is to *analyze evident change in expression level of **a priori sets of gene** in different conditions* [3]. 
![Gene Set Enrichment Analysis](./assets/GSEA.gif)[3]

Going back to our lego analogy, we know that different kind of lego products is consist of different combination of lego building blocks. Knowing how many blocks we have for certain product can help us forsee the look of it to some degree. 

On a similar note, differential expression of a set of genes can correlate with certain phenotype of organism. That's why we want to use gene set enrichment analysis, which we use statistical method to check if there is **evident change in expression of *a sets of gene* under different biological conditions**. 



## 2. Differential Gene Expression Analysis: How?<a name="232"></a>
From the concept review, you probably can see how differential gene expression analysis is a necessary previous step of GSEA. 

To check if a set of genes is expressed differentially, we need to determine if a gene is expressed differentially first. Because we want to focus on GSEA in this chapter, let's take some time to go through the general workflow of DGE (differential gene expression analysis). 

#### 1) General Workflow <a name="2321"></a>
The procedure of DGE can be generally concluded as follow: 
- 1. Normalization 
- 2. Statistical Test
- 3. P value check (P < 0.05, change is statistically significant; otherwise, it is not)

Let's dive into details one by one. 
1. **Normalization**</a>
   
   In RNA-seq downstream analysis, we will know how many reads are mapped to particular genes (that can be roughly taken as measure of expression level sometimes). 
   ![Normalization](./assets/mapping.png) 
   *However, count of reads does not necessarily reflect the actual expression level of a gene.*

   To be specific, it's much easier for a gene that is *longer* and located in *DNA has higher counts of reads mapping* to have more reads mapped to it. Therefore, we need to take **gene length** and **library size** into consideration. That's why we need to first conduct normalization to make sure we get valid expression level from input counts data. Common strategy and equations used for normalziation are presented below. [BENG183 Lecture]

   ![Normalization](./assets/normalization-equations.png) 


2. **Statistical Test**</a>

   We only care about **evident** change in expression level under different conditions. Thus, to make sure the difference in value in not caused by chance, we need to conduct statistical test, usually a t-test, to compare and make sure the change in expression level under different condition is significant.

   ![Differential Analysis](./assets/DGE.png) [5]

3. **P Value Check**</a>

   To check significance, we will use p value generated from t-test and 0.05 as threhold to determine its significance
   
   **If P < 0.05, change is statistically significant; otherwise, it is not significant.**

> Based on these general ideas, we'll walk through one of the most popular techniques for Differential Analysis and then briefly introduce other methods, as well as how to choose tools that work best for GSEA.


## 2.3.2 Overivew of 3C methods<a name="232"></a>

[Figure1](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tplants.2018.03.014). Schematic Representation of Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C) and 3C-Derived Methods. These methods help to elucidate nuclear organization by detecting physical interactions between genetic elements located throughout the genome. Abbreviations: IP, immunoprecipitation; RE, restriction enzyme. **Figure by Sotelo-Silveira, Mariana, et al. Trends in Plant Science (2018).**

To better understand the difference between these methods, I'd like to distingush them between the following couple of aspects:

#### 1) Specificity - What does _one, all, many_ mean<a name="2321"></a>
‘1’, ‘Many’ and ‘All’ indicate how many loci are interrogated in a given experiment. For example, ‘1 versus All’ indicates that the experiment probes the interaction profile between 1 locus and all other potential loci in the genome. ‘All versus All’ means that one can detect the interaction profiles of all loci, genome-wide, and their interactions with all other genomic loci [1].

These kind of specificity is determined by the primer when people use **specific primers** before PCR. 

#### 2) Through-put and resolution<a name="2322"></a>
Hi-C techniques has the highest through-put (billion reads per sample) but suffering of a relative low resolution of 0.1-1Mb. However, the other methods usually have a higher resolution  around 1kb. For more details one can refer to table2 in [2].

## 2.3.3 Hi-C<a name="233"></a>
Hi-C is the highest through-put version of 3C-derived technologies. Due to the decreasing cost of 2nd generation sequencing, hi-c is widely used.

The principle of Hi-C can be illustrated as:

##### Hi-C critical steps [8] 
- Fixation: keep DNA conformed
- Digestion: enzyme frequency and penetratin
- Fill-in: biotin for junction enrichment
- Ligation: freeze interactions in sequence
- Biotin removal: junctions only
- Fragment size: small fragments sequence better
- Adapter ligation: paired-end and indexing
- PCR: create enough material for flow cell

## 2.3.4 ChIA-PET<a name="234"></a> 
ChIA-PET is another method that combines ChIP and pair-end sequencing to analysis the chromtin interaction. It allows for targeted binding factors such as: estrogen receptor alpha, CTCF-mediated loops, RNA polymerase II, and a combination of key architectural factors. on the one hand, it has the benefit of achieving a higher resolution compared to Hi-C, as only ligation products involving the immunoprecipitated molecule are sequenced, on the other hand, ChIA-PET has systematic biases due to ChIP process:
- Only one type of binding factor selected
- Different antibodies
- ChIP conditions
